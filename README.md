# HR Attendance Insights Dashboard 📊

This project is a complete end-to-end **Power BI data analytics project** based on real-world HR attendance data. It demonstrates how to transform raw multi-sheet Excel files into a unified, insightful dashboard that helps HR and leadership teams make informed decisions.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to track and analyze **employee presence**, **work-from-home**, and **sick leave** patterns over a 3-month period using Power BI. This solution enables HR teams to plan better, ensure employee well-being, and maintain productivity.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- Transform raw attendance data from inconsistent Excel formats into a structured model.
- Create interactive dashboards to analyze presence, WFH, and sick leaves.
- Develop DAX-based measures for accurate and meaningful metrics.
- Use real business scenarios to guide the design and implementation.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Power BI** (Power Query, DAX, Dashboard design)
- **Microsoft Excel** (Raw data input)

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Data cleaning and unification across multiple Excel sheets with different headers using Power Query.
- ✅ Key performance metrics:
  - Presence Percentage
  - Work From Home (WFH) %
  - Sick Leave %
- ✅ DAX logic for handling complex cases (e.g. half-day WFH or sick leave).
- ✅ Time slicers and trend visuals for monthly/weekly presence analysis.
- ✅ Row-Level and Object-Level Security (RLS & OLS) to protect sensitive HR data.
- ✅ Designed with stakeholder collaboration (HR Manager, Analytics Manager).
- ✅ Scalable: Logic built to handle new months/data uploads seamlessly.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to handle real-world dirty data using Power Query.
- Importance of stakeholder requirement gathering before building a dashboard.
- Creating reusable transformation logic in Power BI.
- Advanced DAX for complex business metrics.
- Role-based access control for secure dashboards.
- Real-world data storytelling using visuals.
